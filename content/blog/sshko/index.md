## What Is SSHKo?

SSHKo is a lightweight and efficient SSH connection manager designed for those of us who want to streamline the process of connecting to remote servers. With SSHKo, you donâ€™t have to remember each serverâ€™s IP address or username. It keeps track of your connections and provides a user-friendly interface to choose from previously used SSH sessions.

## Why Use SSHKo?
If youâ€™re someone who:

* Finds it tedious to remember multiple SSH connection details.
* Wants to automate the process of managing SSH sessions.
* Prefers a simple solution that doesnâ€™t require a bulky setup.

Then SSHKo is perfect for you. Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to install, and makes your life easier.
## How Does It Work?

SSHKo saves every SSH connection you use in a log file (~/.sshLog.txt). Whenever you want to reconnect, it reads this file and displays all previously used connections in an interactive dialog, allowing you to select the desired session.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to start using SSHKo:
### Step 1: Install and Set Up SSHKo

1. Copy the `sshko.sh` script to a directory of your choice (e.g., `~/sshko.sh`).
2. Add an alias for the script in your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
alias sshko="~/sshko.sh $@"
```
3. Reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2: Run SSHKo
To start using SSHKo, simply type:

```bash
sshko
```
If itâ€™s your first time, youâ€™ll see the message:
```bash
ssh log file is empty
```
### Step 3: Save and Use SSH Connections

Use SSHKo with an SSH connection like this:
```bash
sshko user@192.168.1.101
```
This will:

1. Save the connection details to the `~/.sshLog.txt` file.
2. Execute the SSH connection, prompting you for the password as usual.

The next time you run `sshko` without any arguments, it will present you with a dialog box listing all saved connections (as shown in the image above). Simply select the desired connection and press Enter to connect.

## Key Features
* Automatic Logging: Keeps track of all SSH connections in a simple text file.
* Interactive Interface: Provides a clean dialog box to choose from saved connections.
* Simple Setup: No complicated installations or dependencies â€“ just a shell script.

## Requirements
* SSH must be installed on your system.
* A bash-compatible shell.

## Benefits

* Saves time and effort by eliminating the need to remember and type SSH connection details.
* Keeps your workflow organized and efficient.
* Lightweight and portable â€“ itâ€™s just a script!

## Example Workflow
1. Use SSHKo to connect to a new server:
```bash 
sshko user@192.168.1.101
```
2. Reuse the connection later by simply typing:
```bash 
sshko
```
