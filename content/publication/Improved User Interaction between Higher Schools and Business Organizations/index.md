## Abstract
Continuous dialogue between business and higher education is an important factor in stimulating the training and career development of young people. An effective mechanism for direct contact and user interaction between students and business environments is needed. In the present work, a developed author's web-based platform in the university space is presented. It helps to overcome communication barriers and provides a sustainable link in cooperation between education, science, and business. It provides opportunities for direct contact between students, teachers, and businesses, leading to updating curricula, exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, gaining professional skills in a specific work environment, etc.
