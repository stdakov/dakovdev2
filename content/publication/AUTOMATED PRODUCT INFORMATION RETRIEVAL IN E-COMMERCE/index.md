## Abstract
The recent paper presents automatic retrieval of publicly available information about products on the Internet, analysis and aggregation of this information
and sending the relevant notifications to the users. A Telegram bot has been developed, which periodically checks the information for certain products and analyzes the
retrieved data. This saves customers periodic visits to online stores. A number of commands have been developed and integrated in the bot that can be used by the users.

We give examples of using the developed application for retrieving information about
product availability, increasing or decreasing price, product reviews, posting new ads
on sales sites. Due to the lack of a unified standard for presenting product information
in e-commerce, it was necessary to develop adapters for each site. The application is
based on techniques for web data extraction, microservices and cron jobs. Possibilities
for further development of the presented application are also considered.

Keywords: automated retrieval of information, web scraping, e-commerce, telegram
